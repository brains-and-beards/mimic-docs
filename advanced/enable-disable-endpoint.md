# Enable / Disable Endpoint

Sometimes you could need to receive the real response from a certain endpoint instead of your mocked one. For this reason it is possible _enable / disable_ a certain endpoint.

Every endpoint row has a button on the right to enable or disable that endpoint:

![Enable Disable Endpoint](../Images/disable_enable-buttons.png 'Enable Disable Endpoint')

When an endpoint is _disabled_ it will not be more reachable but, if the API Forwarding settings are been set, the request will be forward to the real API.
